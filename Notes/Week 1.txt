Every thursday evening we have an online live tutorial from 6:30 to 7:30.

CRUD epitomises the fundamentals of database design. Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting stuff in a database.

The roles of HTML, CSS, etc are amalgamating. Content, Styles, and behaviour.

PHP is not behaviour, JS is behaviour. PHP, similiarly to HTML, is content.

HTML is static, PHP is dynamic.

PHP allows the content to change, HTML will always stay the same.

Backend languages are used for every database backend.
