Every thursday evening we have an online live tutorial from 6:30 to 7:30.

CRUD epitomises the fundamentals of database design. Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting stuff in a database.

The roles of HTML, CSS, etc are amalgamating. Content, Styles, and behaviour.

PHP is not behaviour, JS is behaviour. PHP, similiarly to HTML, is content.

HTML is static, PHP is dynamic.

PHP allows the content to change, HTML will always stay the same.

Backend languages are used for every database backend. 

Reddit's backend stack is Python and Flask as the server side language. It is a Ngnix server. That being said, the HTML, JS, and CSS are always the same.

For linux, the backend is PHP, and the server is Apache, and it uses MySQL.
